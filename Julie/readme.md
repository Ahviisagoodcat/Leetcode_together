# This is Julie! 

## My daily progress are as follows.
 ### Day 1(11/05/2021): 
 Review two number sum and code for three number sum. Got O(n^3) solution.
 
 Learned using append to store an array in the list.
 ### Day 2(11/06/2021): 
 Modify code for three number sum to get optimal solution O(n^2). 
 
 Review Validate Subsequence. The key is fixing the value from array, compare each of the elements in the sequence.
 ### Day 3(11/07/2021): 
Sorted Square Array. Use inner function to get O(nlogn) in time but we can get O(n) by using manual sort similarly to two number sum. 

Find smallest difference element from two given array. 
 ### Day 4(11/08/2021): 
Non-Constructible Change. When current coin value greater than the currentchangeCreated+1, we can't make the change. This logic need to be digested. 

Move Element to End. The key is using two index, one in the front and the other one in the end.Use this array[i], array[j] = array[j], array[i] to swap two         element.  
 ### Day 5(11/09/2021): 
Monotonic Array: learn to use a flag

Spiral Traverse

 ### Day 6(11/10/2021):
Looking for missing numbers: Learn to read the standard input stream (console)by using input() and transform it to certain type. 
1. Using split() and Map(): 
Split() function helps in getting multiple inputs from users. It breaks the given input by the specified separator. If a separator is not provided then any white space is a separator. Generally, users use a split() method to split a Python string but one can use it in taking multiple inputs.
Map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable.Use the Python Map Function to transform the list of strings to a list of integers.

Find all prime numbers in [1,n]

 ### Day 7(11/11/2021):
Find the longest peak length

 ### Day 8(11/12/2021):
Find the product of array

 ### Day 9(11/13/2021):
Find the first duplicate value in array

Learn about using set() in python:A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. Pythonâ€™s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set. The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list, is that it has a highly optimized method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set. This is based on a data structure known as a hash table. Since sets are unordered, we cannot access items using indexes like we do in lists. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sets-in-python/

Need to find more examples to practice the idea of using set().

 ### Day 10(11/14/2021):
Merge overlapping intervals
Learn to sort an array by a key parameter.

 ### Day 11(11/15/2021):
Four number sum.
Consider about adding two number sum

 ### Day 12(11/16/2021):
Write a function that takes in an array of at least two integers and that returns an array of the starting and ending indices of the smallest subarray in the input array that needs to be sorted in place in order for the entire input array tp be sorted.

 ### Day 13(11/17/2021):
 Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns an array of length 2 representing the largest range of integres contained in that array.
 
 Need to use the hash table again. 

 ### Day 14(11/18/2021):
 Write a function that takes in a list of scores and returns the Minimum number of rewards that you must give out to students to satisfy the two rules.
 1. All studetns must receive at least one reward.
 2. Any given students must receive strictly more rewards than an adjacent students( a student immediately to the left or to the right) with a lower score and must receive strictly fewer rewards than an adjacent student with a higher score. 
 Understand the second rule is important. 
 
 ### Day 14(11/20/2021):
 Redo minmum reward question. 
 
 ### Day 15(11/21/2021):
 Zigzag traverse:
Zigzag order starts at the top left corner of the two-dimensional array, goes down by one element, and proceeds in a zigzag parttern all the way to the bottom right corner. 

Figure out the partern for the index changing is important. In general, separate them to two way, one is go down-left and the other one is go up-right. Then need to consider the border case. 

 ### Day 16(11/22/2021):
 Fnd the max sum of non-adjacent elemnets. Understand the skills for Dynamic programming, it's bottom-up pattern.
 Max(i) = max{max(i-1), max(i-2)+current elements}
