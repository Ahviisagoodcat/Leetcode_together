# This is Julie! 

## My daily progress are as follows.
 ### Day 1(11/05/2021): 
      Review two number sum and code for three number sum. Got O(n^3) solution. Learned using append to store an array in the list.
 ### Day 2(11/06/2021): 
      Modify code for three number sum to get optimal solution O(n^2). Review Validate Subsequence. The key is fixing the value from array, compare each of the elements in the sequence.
 ### Day 3(11/07/2021): 
      Sorted Square Array. Use inner function to get O(nlogn) in time but we can get O(n) by using manual sort similarly to two number sum. 
      Find smallest difference element from two given array.
