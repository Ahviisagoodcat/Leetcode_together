# This is Julie! 

## My daily progress are as follows.
 ### Day 1(11/05/2021): 
 Review two number sum and code for three number sum. Got O(n^3) solution. Learned using append to store an array in the list.
 ### Day 2(11/06/2021): 
 Modify code for three number sum to get optimal solution O(n^2). Review Validate Subsequence. The key is fixing the value from array, compare each of the elements in the sequence.
 ### Day 3(11/07/2021): 
Sorted Square Array. Use inner function to get O(nlogn) in time but we can get O(n) by using manual sort similarly to two number sum. 
Find smallest difference element from two given array. 
 ### Day 4(11/08/2021): 
Non-Constructible Change. When current coin value greater than the currentchangeCreated+1, we can't make the change. This logic need to be digested. 
Move Element to End. The key is using two index, one in the front and the other one in the end.Use this array[i], array[j] = array[j], array[i] to swap two         element.  
 ### Day 5(11/09/2021): 
Monotonic Array
Spiral Traverse
Figure out the simple construction rule is important 
 ### Day 6(11/10/2021):
Q1.Looking for missing numbers: Learn to read the standard input stream (console)by using input() and transform it to certain type. 
1. Using split() and Map(): 
Split() function helps in getting multiple inputs from users. It breaks the given input by the specified separator. If a separator is not provided then any white space is a separator. Generally, users use a split() method to split a Python string but one can use it in taking multiple inputs.
Map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable.Use the Python Map Function to transform the list of strings to a list of integers.

Q2.Find all prime numbers in [1,n]
