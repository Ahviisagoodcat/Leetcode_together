# This is Julie! 

## My daily progress are as follows.
 ### Day 1(11/05/2021): 
      Review two number sum and code for three number sum. Got O(n^3) solution. Learned using append to store an array in the list.
 ### Day 2(11/06/2021): 
      Modify code for three number sum to get optimal solution O(n^2). Review Validate Subsequence.
